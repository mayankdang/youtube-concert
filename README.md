## Concert. Party with a hashtag!

Party with a #hashtag.

Play the same YouTube videos on many computers. Control, play or pause them as you desire. Be your party's own DJ. House parties will never be the same again. With just a hashtag you can broadcast one single video on multiple devices. You're just a hashtag away from creating your own house-concert.

### To Create your Concert
Once you have added Concert Extension to Chrome, go to the first YouTube video you want to play. Add your concert name at the end of the URL as a hashtag. Don't forget to add another # at the end and Press Enter ↵. The # at the end ensures that you want to start a new concert. Ask your friends to join your concert.

Now enjoy the effect on many screens at once.

### To Join someone's Concert
